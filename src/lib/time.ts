 * WHAT: Unix epoch timestamp utilities for deterministic test-friendly timestamps.
 * WHY: SQLite defaults can't be mocked in tests; explicit timestamps keep tests predictable.
 * time is a flat circle (also it's in seconds not milliseconds)
 *
 * GOTCHA: This entire file assumes seconds. If you're coming from browser-land where
 * Date.now() gives you milliseconds, you will be off by a factor of 1000 and your
 * timestamps will be from the year 51970. Ask me how I know.
 * FLOWS:
 *  - nowUtc() → current Unix seconds (INTEGER for SQLite)
 *  - tsToIso() → convert Unix seconds back to ISO8601 string
 * DOCS:
 *  - Unix epoch: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time
 *  - Date.now(): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now
 *
 * NOTE: All timestamps in review_action.created_at are Unix seconds (INTEGER), not milliseconds.
