/**
 * Translates raw errors into user-friendly hints. Discord error codes are cryptic;
 * users shouldn't need to google "10062" to understand what happened.
 *
 * Note: These hints appear in ephemeral embeds, so they can be slightly technical
 * since only the affected user sees them. Keep them actionable where possible.
 *
 * Supported Discord API error codes (sorted numerically):
 * - 10003: Unknown Channel - channel deleted or bot lacks visibility
 * - 10008: Unknown Message - message deleted or inaccessible
 * - 10062: Unknown Interaction - interaction expired (3s window)
 * - 30001: Maximum guilds reached - bot in too many servers
 * - 30007: Maximum webhooks reached - channel webhook limit
 * - 30010: Maximum roles reached - guild role limit
 * - 30013: Maximum reactions reached - message reaction limit
 * - 40001: Unauthorized - invalid token or missing OAuth2 scope
 * - 40060: Already acknowledged - double reply attempt
 * - 50001: Missing Access - bot can't access resource
 * - 50013: Missing Permissions - insufficient channel/guild perms
 * - 50035: Invalid Form Body - malformed API request (likely bot bug)
 *
 * Also handles:
 * - SqliteError with "no such table" - schema mismatch
 * - "Unhandled modal" message - modal router mismatch
