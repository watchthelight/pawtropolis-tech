/**
 * Pawtropolis Tech — src/features/analytics/queries.ts
 * WHAT: Pure query functions for reviewer analytics.
 * WHY: Provides insight into moderator activity, review velocity, and queue health.
 * FLOWS:
 *  - getActionCountsByMod → per-moderator action breakdown
 *  - getLeadTimeStats → review velocity (p50/p90/mean)
 *  - getTopReasons → most common rejection reasons
 *  - getVolumeSeries → time-bucketed action volumes
 *  - getOpenQueueAge → pending application age distribution
 * DOCS:
 *  - better-sqlite3: https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3
 *  - Percentile calculation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile
 *
 * NOTE: All timestamps are Unix epoch seconds (INTEGER). All queries use prepared statements.
