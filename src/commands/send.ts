/**

 * WHAT: Anonymous /send command for staff to post messages as the bot.
 * WHY: Allows moderation team to communicate anonymously without revealing identity.
 * FLOWS:
 *  - /send message:"text" → bot posts in same channel, replies "Sent ✅" ephemerally
 *  - Supports embeds, replies, attachments, and configurable mention blocking
 *  - Logs to audit channel if configured (LOGGING_CHANNEL or LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID)
 * DOCS:
