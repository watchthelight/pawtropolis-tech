## [4.9.1] - 2026-01-07

### Changed

- **`/unclaim` Admin Override** — Administrators+ can now unclaim applications claimed by other staff members. Previously, only the person who claimed an application could unclaim it. This allows admins to resolve stalemates when a staff member is unavailable.

---

## [4.9.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automated quality checks on every push/PR:

  - Build verification for production readiness
- **Dynamic README Badges** - Auto-updating badges via GitHub Gist:
  - Commands count, lines of code, test count, coverage percentage, version
  - Updated automatically on push to main (every 6 hours fallback)
  - Scripts in `scripts/generate-badge-metrics.js`
- **Status Endpoint** - Bot now serves `/api/status` and `/api/health` endpoints:
  - Shields.io-compatible JSON format for status badges
  - Shows online/offline status, uptime, WebSocket latency
  - Runs on port 3002 (configurable via `STATUS_PORT` env var)
- **Auto-Commit Assets** - `/update banner` and `/update avatar` now auto-push to GitHub:
  - Assets saved to `assets/` folder and committed automatically
  - Requires `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME`, `GITHUB_BOT_EMAIL`, `GITHUB_REPO` env vars
  - Reply includes link to GitHub commit on success
- **Professional README** - Redesigned with centered banner, avatar, and badge rows

- **Security Issue Acknowledgments** - Staff can now acknowledge security warnings that are intentional:
  - `/audit acknowledge <issue-id> [reason]` - Mark a security warning as intentional (e.g., Chat Reviver needs MentionEveryone)
  - `/audit unacknowledge <issue-id>` - Remove acknowledgment if you change your mind
  - Acknowledged issues appear in a separate "Acknowledged Issues" section in CONFLICTS.md
  - Acknowledgments auto-reset when underlying permissions change (forcing re-review)
  - Shows who acknowledged each issue and when, with optional reason
- **Server Audit Documentation** - Comprehensive internal documentation of server structure:
  - `docs/internal-info/ROLES.md` - All 219 roles with positions, colors, member counts, and full permission matrix
  - `docs/internal-info/CHANNELS.md` - All 225 channels with categories, types, and permission overwrites

  - `scripts/audit-server-full.ts` - Re-runnable script to regenerate documentation

- **Incident Log** - Added `INCIDENTS.md` to track production incidents and resolutions
- **Game Night Tracking** - New `/event game` command for game night attendance tracking with percentage-based qualification:
  - `/event game start #channel` - Start tracking attendance in a voice channel
  - `/event game end` - End event and calculate qualification based on % of event duration attended
  - `/event game attendance` - View attendance stats (live during event, historical after)
  - `/event game add/credit/bump` - Manual attendance adjustments

  - `/roles add-game-tier` - Configure tier roles (e.g., 1 game = T1, 5 games = T2)
  - `/roles remove-game-tier` - Remove a game tier
  - `/roles list` - View configured game tiers
  - Automatically assigns roles when users qualify, removes lower tiers

- **Unified Event System** - `/event movie` now mirrors `/movie` (which is deprecated). Both movie and game nights use the same underlying tracking system.
- **Combined Event Stats** - Movie and game night attendance tracked in same database for unified statistics

### Security

- **Guild Allowlist** - Bot now only operates in Pawtropolis (guild ID `896070888594759740`). Automatically leaves any other server it's added to. See INC-001 in `INCIDENTS.md`.

### Fixed

- **Movie Night DM Role Display** - DMs now show the actual role name (e.g., "Movie Buff") instead of "@unknown-role" since role mentions don't render in DMs

### Changed

- **Repository Renamed** - Repo renamed from `pawtech-v2` to `pawtropolis-tech`. All URLs and references updated throughout codebase.
- **Documentation Unified Events** - All staff docs now reference both movie and game nights under unified "Events" section:
  - BOT-HANDBOOK: Combined Movie Night + Game Night into single Events section
  - MODERATOR-GUIDE, MOD-QUICKREF: Updated with both event types and commands
  - ADMIN-GUIDE: Added game tier role commands
- **Badge Files Reorganized** - Moved badge JSON files from root to `.github/badges/` for cleaner project structure
- **Modmail Open Message** - Now includes clearer instructions: explains that replies go to staff only, are confidential, and verification continues after modmail closes
- **Permission System Redesign** - Commands now use specific role names instead of generic "staff" permissions. Each command requires a minimum role level. Bot owners and server devs can bypass all restrictions. Error messages show which roles you need. See `PERMS-MATRIX.md` for details.
- **Analytics Command Consolidation** - Unified analytics commands under `/stats`:
  - `/activity` → `/stats activity`
  - `/approval-rate` → `/stats approval-rate`
  - `/modstats leaderboard` → `/stats leaderboard`
  - `/modstats user` → `/stats user`
  - `/modstats export` → `/stats export`
  - `/modstats reset` → `/stats reset`
  - `/modhistory` → `/stats history`

### Removed

- **`/activity`** - Replaced by `/stats activity`
