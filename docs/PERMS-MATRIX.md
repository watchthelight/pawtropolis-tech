## Role Hierarchy

Staff roles are organized in a strict hierarchy. Higher-ranked roles automatically have access to commands available to lower-ranked roles (when using "X+" notation).

| Rank | Role | Role ID | Abbreviation |
|:----:|------|---------|:------------:|
| 1 | Server Owner | `896070888779317254` | SO |
| 2 | Community Manager | `1190093021170114680` | CM |
| 3 | Community Development Lead | `1382242769468260352` | CDL |
| 4 | Senior Administrator | `1420440472169746623` | SA |
| 5 | Administrator | `896070888779317248` | A |
| 6 | Senior Moderator | `1095757038899953774` | SM |
| 7 | Moderator | `896070888762535975` | M |
| 8 | Junior Moderator | `896070888762535966` | JM |
| 9 | Gatekeeper | `896070888762535969` | GK |
| 10 | Moderation Team | `987662057069482024` | MT |

**Note:** Moderation Team (MT) is view-only and cannot use most commands.

## Special Bypass Roles

These roles bypass all permission checks and have full access to every command:

| Role | ID | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Server Dev | `1120074045883420753` | Staff role with full access |
| Bot Owner | User ID: `697169405422862417` | Hardcoded user ID |

---

## Permission Types

Commands use different permission systems:

### Role-Based Hierarchical ("X+")

**"X+"** means the specified role and all roles above it in the hierarchy.

Example: **"Senior Mod+"** (SM+) includes:
- Senior Moderator, Administrator, Senior Administrator, CDL, Community Manager, Server Owner
- Plus Server Dev and Bot Owner bypass

### Role-Based Explicit ("[X]")

**"[X]"** means only that specific role, regardless of hierarchy.

Example: **"[GK]"** means only the Gatekeeper role can use the command.

### Discord Permission Based

Some commands use Discord's built-in permission system (e.g., ManageMessages, ManageRoles) rather than role-based checks. These are indicated with the Discord permission name.

---

## Commands by Permission Level

### Public Commands (Anyone)

Commands available to all server members:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Interactive help system with category browsing and search |
| `/health` | Check bot status, uptime, and connection health |
| `/art getstatus` | Check progress of your personal art reward |
| `/sample` | Preview UI components for training purposes |

### Gatekeeper Only [GK]

Commands restricted to the Gatekeeper role specifically. Higher roles do NOT automatically have access.

**Why Gatekeeper only?** Application handling is a specialized role. Higher-ranked staff who don't handle applications shouldn't accidentally process them.

## Technical Reference

### Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/roles.ts` | Role constants, hierarchy, and permission helpers |
| `src/lib/config.ts` | Permission check functions (`requireMinRole`, `requireGatekeeper`, etc.) |
| `src/lib/permissionCard.ts` | Permission denied embed generation |

### Permission Check Functions

```typescript
// Hierarchical check - requires role X or higher
requireMinRole(interaction, ROLE_IDS.SENIOR_MOD, options)

// Exact role check - requires specific role(s) only
requireExactRoles(interaction, [ROLE_IDS.GATEKEEPER], options)

// Convenience functions
requireGatekeeper(interaction, commandName, description)
requireOwnerOnly(interaction, commandName, description)
requireArtist(interaction, commandName, description)
```

### Bypass Logic

The permission system always checks bypass conditions first:

1. **Bot Owner check** — If `userId === "697169405422862417"`, always pass
2. **Server Dev check** — If member has role `1120074045883420753`, always pass
3. **Then** apply the specific permission check
