# Modmail Guide

Talk with applicants privately through Discord threads.

## What It Does

Modmail lets you message an applicant without involving your personal DMs. Conversations happen in a private thread inside the review channel — only staff can see the thread, and the bot relays messages back and forth between the thread and the applicant's DMs.

Key features:
- Private threads in the review channel
- Messages auto-forward between thread and applicant DMs
- Open, close, and reopen threads
- Shows on review cards when an app is claimed

## How to Use

### Open Modmail

**From Review Card:**
1. Claim the application first
2. Click "Modmail" button
3. A private thread opens
4. You're auto-added to the thread
5. Applicant gets a DM notification

**From Context Menu:**
1. Right-click the review card
2. Select "Modmail: Open"

**What's in the thread:**
- Applicant info (tag, app code, join date, avatar)
- "Close" button
- "Copy Lens Link" button (for image search)

### Send Messages

**You write in thread -> applicant gets DM:**
- Any message you send in the thread goes to the applicant
