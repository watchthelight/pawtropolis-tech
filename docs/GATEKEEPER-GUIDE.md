You review applications and decide who gets into the server.

## What You Can Do

### The Gate System

This is your bread and butter. When someone wants to join the server, they fill out an application. You review it and decide: accept, reject, or kick.

**The flow:**
1. Someone clicks Verify in the gate channel
2. A review card appears in your staff channel
3. You claim it (so others know you're handling it)
4. You make the call — Accept, Reject, or Kick
5. The bot handles the rest (roles, DMs, welcome messages)

**Commands:**
- `/accept` — Approve an application (they get the member role)
- `/reject reason:... [perm:true]` — Deny with explanation (optionally permanent)
- `/kick reason:...` — Remove without formal rejection (can reapply)
- `/unclaim` — Release a claimed application for someone else
- `/listopen` — See pending applications (`scope:all` for everything)
- `/search user:@Name` — Look up someone's application history

**Identifying applications:** Use ONE of these with any command:
- `app:A1B2C3` — The short code on the review card
- `user:@Username` — Mention or pick from list
- `uid:123456789` — Discord ID (for users who left)

### Working with Claims

**Always claim before reviewing.** This prevents two mods from working on the same application.

- Click "Claim Application" on the review card
- The card updates to show you've claimed it
- Other mods see "Claimed by @YourName"
- Take your action (accept/reject/kick)
- If you need to step away, use `/unclaim` to release it

**Pro tip:** If buttons aren't working, use the slash commands instead. They do the same thing.

### Flagging Suspicious Users

See something off? Flag them for other staff to notice.

**Command:**
- `/flag user:@Username reason:Why they're suspicious`

Flagged users get a warning indicator on their review card. Good reasons to flag:
- Possible alt account of banned user
- Suspicious join pattern
- Failed password multiple times
- Username matches known problem users

### AI Detection

Someone submitted art that looks AI-generated? Check it.

**Command:**
- `/isitreal message:<message_id_or_link>` — Scans images for AI generation

**Quick method:** Right-click any message → Apps → "Is It Real?"

The bot uses multiple detection services and shows confidence scores. Not perfect, but helps catch obvious AI art.

📋 *Introduced in [v4.6.0](../CHANGELOG.md#460---2025-12-03)* | *Context menu added in [v4.8.0](../CHANGELOG.md#480---2025-12-08)*

### Checking Your Stats

Curious how you're doing? The bot tracks your reviews.

**Commands:**
- `/modstats user moderator:@YourName` — Your personal stats
- `/modstats leaderboard` — See how everyone's doing

Stats include:
- Total reviews (accepts, rejects, kicks)
- Average response time
- Activity breakdown by day

📖 [Full documentation →](../BOT-HANDBOOK.md#modstats)

📋 *Introduced in [v1.0.0](../CHANGELOG.md#100---2025-11-25)*

---

### Getting Help

**Commands:**
- `/help` — Interactive help browser (search or browse by category)
- `/health` — Check if the bot is running properly

**Something broken?** Check the [Troubleshooting section](../BOT-HANDBOOK.md#troubleshooting) in the handbook.

**Still stuck?** Ask in staff chat. Include:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- The application code (like `A1B2C3`) if relevant

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't forget to claim** — Always claim before reviewing
2. **Use ONE identifier** — Don't mix `app:`, `user:`, and `uid:` in the same command
3. **`perm:true` is permanent** — Only use for obvious spam/bots/rule violations
4. **Check the password** — Most rejections are just wrong passwords; they can try again
