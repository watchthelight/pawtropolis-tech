# Gate and Review Flow

How the application system works.

## Step 1: User Submits Application

1. User types `/gate`
2. Bot shows form with fields:
   - Display Name (2-32 chars)
   - Age (must be 18+)
   - Reason (min 50 chars)
   - Referral (optional)
3. User submits form
4. Bot validates and saves to database
5. Bot posts review card in review channel

## Step 2: Moderator Claims

1. Mod clicks "Claim" button on review card
2. Bot checks if already claimed
3. If available, bot assigns to mod
4. Button changes to "Unclaim"
5. Card color changes to yellow

## Step 3: Accept or Reject

**To Accept:**
```
/accept app_id:123 reason:"Welcome!"
```

**To Reject:**
```
/reject app_id:123 reason:"Doesn't meet requirements"
```

Both commands:
- Update database
- Send DM to user
- Update review card color
- Log to audit channel

## Review Card Colors

- Blue = Pending (unclaimed)
- Yellow = Claimed by a mod
- Green = Accepted
- Red = Rejected

## Database Flow

```
Application submitted
  → review_action table (status: pending)
  → action_log (action: submit)

Mod claims
  → review_action (claimed_by, claimed_at)
  → action_log (action: claim)

Mod accepts
  → review_action (status: accepted, decided_at)
  → action_log (action: accept, reason)
  → User gets member role
  → User gets DM

Mod rejects
  → review_action (status: rejected, decided_at)
  → action_log (action: reject, reason)
  → User gets DM
  → Optionally kicked (if auto_kick_rejected=1)
```

## DM Templates

Acceptance and rejection DMs can be customized with `/config set`:

```
/config set acceptance_message "Welcome to the community!"
/config set rejection_message "Thanks for applying..."
```

## Unclaiming

If a mod claims by mistake:
```
/unclaim app_id:123
```

This releases the application back to the queue.

## Common Issues

**Application not showing?**
- Check review channel is set correctly
- Bot needs Send Messages permission

**Can't claim?**
- Someone else already claimed it
- Refresh to see current status

**DM not sent?**
- User has DMs disabled
- Bot still completes the action

## Known Issues

- Applications don't show in stats until claimed (need to add submit action to action_log)
- Pretty cards sometimes don't post to logging channel (logging_channel_id missing from config)
