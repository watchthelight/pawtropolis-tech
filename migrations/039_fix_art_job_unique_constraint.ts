/**
 * Migration 039: Fix art_job unique constraint
 *
 * WHAT: Add UNIQUE constraint on (guild_id, artist_id, artist_job_number)
 * WHY: Prevents race condition where two simultaneous job creations could
 *      get the same artist_job_number, making it impossible to select the
 *      correct job when using /art finish id:N
 *
 * Also fixes any existing duplicates by renumbering them.
